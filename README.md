## Something to note
- feel free to update/contribute to this repository, these are my personal Makefiles that I use in my projects and I thought it would be a good idea to share them with the community.
- if you do use these makefiles, please make sure to update the `PROJECT_NAME` variable in the Makefile to match your project name. and please update the configuration to match your project setup.
